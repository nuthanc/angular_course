# Directives - Course Project

### Building and Using a Dropdown Directive

* We are building a Directive which attaches a certain class when clicked and removes it after clicking it again
* The class name is open which when added to div in recipe-detail, the Dropdown opens
* Check dropdown.directive.ts in shared folder
* You can create through cli using ng c d shared/dropdown but for practise creating it manually
